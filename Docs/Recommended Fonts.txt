I strongly suggest using exclusively monospaced fonts, which letters and characters each occupy the same amount of horizontal space.

If you don't use a monospaced font you can get problems displaying text and numbers. For example, I've notes that on the nextion display the letter "W" upper case would show as lowercase.

For that reason I listed my recommended fonts that I tested to work well for the Nextion display:

BatangChe
Consolas
